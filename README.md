# Brain Tumor MRI Imaging - Classifcation Using Machine Learning
## Background
The detection and diagnosis of brain tumors can be a difficult task that frequently calls for a combination of imaging and clinical knowledge. Due to the severity of the condition, as well as varying symptoms and survival rates for different types of tumors, developing machine learning models which can accurately detect and classify different types of brain tumor can be vital in improving patient outlook. The accuracy and effectiveness of detecting brain tumors have shown considerable promise due to recent developments in machine learning approaches. In this paper, we will take a dataset which consists of MRI images of brain scans with the presence of different types of tumors, as well as brain scans with no tumor present, and examine and fine tune a variety of machine learning algorithms in order to accurately detect and classify different types of tumors.

While the field of neurology offers a plethora of ways of detecting brain tumors, one common approach is through the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Deciphering these images can be challenging, particularly when working with intricate systems like the brain; furthermore, reading MRI scans one by one by doctors is not a scalable solution.

## Research Objectives
For this paper, we aim to use machine learning to simplify the task of detecting tumors. There are several types of ML algorithms that can be used for this task, including supervised learning as well as deep learning.

Typically, image classification tasks are done using deep learning, however our goal is to construct and compare several classification models in addition to deep learning, to study and investigate their effectiveness as well as understand why some models perform better than others. Using the task of determining the best classifier, we also aim to obtain an understanding of how each classifier works.

## Data Source
For our data source we have used the data set listed on Kaggle as a competition in 2021 (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset). The data set consists of 7023 images which are classified into 4 classes - Glioma, Meningiomas, Pituitary and No tumor.
